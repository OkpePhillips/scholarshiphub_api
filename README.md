# ScholarshipHub

`ScholarshipHub` is a project designed to provide users with access to scholarship opportunities from top institutions in the world. Users can learn more about the scholarship, eligibility criteria, benefits of the scholarship, as well as how and where to apply.

Furthermore, registered users can equally request for professional review of their `Statement of Purpose` so as to improve their chances of getting scholarships. Besides, the comment functionality means that users can ask for clarification on any scholarship post. A comment can also have replies to it.

There are `Admin Processes` like creating and editing a scholarship post, retrieving all users, deleting a user and uploading a reviewed statement of purpose.

The API is properly documented using Django rest framework `Yet Another Swagger Generator` to make it easy for use.
